# You don't need uvicorn[standard] here as Vercel handles the ASGI server.
# Also, python-dotenv, pyyaml, uvloop, watchfiles, websockets, httptools, h11, click, anyio, sniffio, idna
# are often pulled as dependencies of uvicorn and starlette, or are not strictly needed by the serverless handler.
# If you encounter issues, you might need to add specific versions from your local pip freeze.
